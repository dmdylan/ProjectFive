# ProjectFive
My first video game fully developed by me without following tutorials or classes. ProjectFive is a placeholder title, or the current working title, haven't quite figured that one out yet. I'm posting the code here as this is a learning experience for me and if others have questions they might be able to look at what I did for solutions.

Some gifs of the game through various stages of development can be found below. Some video clips of the game can also be found on my twitter https://twitter.com/SpartanFanDMD.
